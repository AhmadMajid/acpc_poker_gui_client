== The Design of this Application

While the ACPC Poker GUI Client is currently implemented in Ruby over the Rails
web framework, its design should be agnostic to such details. One language or
framework should be transparently swappable with its current implementation.

== Interface to the User

As this is a web application, the browser is the only interface between
the _user_ and the application.

== Matches

Users may participate in matches
*  Users may _host_ a match and invite other users and/or select _bots_ to participate
   *  This application must inform all _participants_ of the ports that they must to use to connect to the <em>ACPC Dealer</em>
*  Users may accept invitations to matches hosted by other competitors
   *  This application must be informed of the host name and port number it must use to connect to the dealer
*  This application must know what the dealer's match parameters are


== Playing Matches

Users may play matches
*  Users may see the dealer's match parameters
*  Users may see the current state of the match
*
